 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false
 * Time O(N) | Space O(1)
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
